## TrashPlay

[Download current version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0jf9bbckhkohtk/TrasPlay_0.1.roflcopter.apk)

TrashPlay is a simple music player to play during car trips and other events that need a Trash Playlist (for reasons). It offers only one button. Play. There is no skipping and no pausing. Ever.

The player takes its music from the Dropbox, using a folder called _DropBoxTrashPlaylistDerHoelle_. You should share that folder with all the people who will be on the car ride to put music in. TrashPlay will not use any other folder. Ever.

The player is nice to your band width and synchronizes only when you are in a Wifi. The music in your Dropbox folder will be put on your phone. Music that isn't in the folder will not stay on the phone. Ever.

If you enable last.fm (that is, when the last.fm button is grey) it scrobbles the music you listen to a specific last.fm account. This last.fm-account represents the record of all music played on any TrashPlayer. Ever.

If you turn down the volume of the phone, it will, after a few graceful minutes, turn back up. You cannot silence the trash. Ever.

## Next Up (version 0.1.dayum)
* Better UI
* Some Work On The Code

## Ideas for Future Releases (0.2.hundimbuero)**

* Since Trash-Playlists are a social thing, this app will, in the near future, be a server, connecting to phones in its environment, as clients, who can in some way (to be determined) the playlist or the experience for other users of the TrashPlay. This will be exiting, and strange. And I have no Idea yet how it will work. 
* Weighted probabilities. There are reasons (for example special purpose songs) that should occur with higher probability
* Geofencing feature. Certain Songs that get palyed when entering or exiting specific locations. Possibly as a global feature...
